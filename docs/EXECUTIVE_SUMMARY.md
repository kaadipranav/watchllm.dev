## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why This Will Work:
1. **$0 infrastructure** = profitable from day one
2. **Low prices** = faster adoption, easier sell
3. **Free tier** = removes signup friction
4. **Clear value prop** = "You saved $X" is irresistible
5. **Multiple revenue streams** = cash flow stability
6. **Existing demand** = people are actively complaining about OpenAI costs

### Your Unfair Advantages:
1. **Student Pack** = $1,235/month in free tools
2. **Speed** = Can ship features in days
3. **Low overhead** = No salary, no team
4. **Hunger** = You NEED this to work
5. **Price** = Competitors charge $99-299/month

### Why Others Will Fail:
1. They'll spend 6 months "perfecting" their product
2. They'll price too high ($99+)
3. They'll wait for inbound (no aggressive outreach)
4. They'll give up after Week 3
5. They won't track metrics daily

**You're doing the opposite = you'll win.**

## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS (AVOID THESE)

| **Targeting Everyone** | Nobody converts | Focus on ChatGPT wrapper makers first |
| **Underpricing Services** | Burn out for pennies | $99 minimum for any service |
| **Giving Up Too Early** | Quit before compounding kicks in | Commit to 90 days minimum |
