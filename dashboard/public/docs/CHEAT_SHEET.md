## 💬 OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Twitter DM:
```
Hey [Name]! 

Saw you're building [Product]. What's your monthly OpenAI bill?

Most wrapper makers I talk to are paying $300-2k/mo 
and don't realize 40-60% is duplicate requests.

Built a caching proxy that cuts costs in half. 
Free tier, 2-min setup.

Want the link?
```

### Product Hunt Founder:
```
[Name], congrats on launching [Product]! 🎉

Are you caching your OpenAI responses?

I built WatchLLM - drops in as a proxy, 
caches similar requests, saves 40-70%.

Here's a demo: [Loom]

Free to start. Lemme know if you want to try!
```
