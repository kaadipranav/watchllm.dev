Title: Building WatchLLM: An Indie Hacker's Journey to Cutting AI API Costs by 40-70%

Tags: #SaaS #LLM

Hey everyone, I'm excited to share my latest project, WatchLLM, a SaaS platform that helps reduce AI API costs through semantic caching. To make this launch more interesting, I've decided to do it as an interview with myself – kinda meta, but hey, solo founders gotta do what they gotta do. So, let's dive in.

Interviewer: Pranav, thanks for joining us today. Can you tell us what WatchLLM is all about?

Pranav: Sure thing. WatchLLM is an AI API cost optimization platform. Basically, it caches semantically similar prompts at the edge, so when you send the same or very similar requests to OpenAI or other LLMs, you get instant responses that cost nothing. We're talking 40-70% savings on your API bills. And the best part? It's drop-in compatible – just change the baseURL and API key, and you're good to go.

Interviewer: That sounds impressive. What inspired you to build this?

Pranav: Well, I've been working on AI projects for a while now, building chatbots and wrappers for clients. One day, I was looking at my OpenAI bill and thought, "This is insane." We're paying for the same responses over and over. Semantic caching seemed like the obvious solution. I researched it, and turns out, it's not new, but no one had made it easy to use for SaaS builders. So I decided to build it myself.

Interviewer: How did you get started? What's the tech stack?

Pranav: I started with Next.js for the dashboard – it's fast and great for SaaS. For the backend, I used Cloudflare Workers because they're edge-deployed, perfect for low-latency caching. Database is Supabase, which is PostgreSQL under the hood, and for caching, Upstash Redis. Payments through Stripe, emails via Resend. Kept it simple, you know?

Interviewer: Sounds solid. What were some challenges you faced?

Pranav: Oh man, plenty. First, getting the semantic similarity right. I had to fine-tune embeddings to catch similar prompts without false positives. Then, scaling – Cloudflare Workers are great, but managing state across edges was tricky. Also, security – handling API keys securely was a big deal. And don't get me started on testing. I had to mock OpenAI responses for weeks.

Interviewer: How do users get started with WatchLLM?

Pranav: Super easy. Sign up at watchllm.dev, create a project, generate a key, and point your client to our proxy URL. Send a request twice – the second one should be cached and free. Here's a screenshot of the dashboard setup:

Interviewer: What's the pricing like?

Pranav: We're in beta right now, everything's free for testing. But when we launch, it'll be $0 for 50k requests, $29 for 250k, and $49 for 1M. Fair, I think.

Interviewer: Can you show us the dashboard?

Pranav: Absolutely. Here's the main dashboard view:

You can see requests, costs saved, hit rates – all in real-time. We also have alerts and logs.

Interviewer: Who is this for?

Pranav: ChatGPT wrapper makers, AI agencies, anyone building on top of LLMs. If you're sending similar prompts repeatedly, this saves you money.

Interviewer: What's next for WatchLLM?

Pranav: More integrations – Anthropic, Groq are already supported. Maybe BYOK (bring your own key) for enterprise. And expanding the team, hopefully.

Interviewer: Any advice for other indie hackers?

Pranav: Build what you need. Don't overcomplicate. Ship fast, iterate. And talk to users early.

Interviewer: Thanks Pranav, this has been great.

Pranav: Thanks for having me!

There you have it, folks. WatchLLM is live in beta – check it out at watchllm.dev. If you're in AI, give it a try and let me know what you think.

(Word count: 652 – oops, a bit short. Let me expand.)

Interviewer: Pranav, let's dive deeper. How exactly does the semantic caching work?

Pranav: Good question. When a request comes in, we generate an embedding for the prompt using OpenAI's embedding model. Then we search our cache for similar embeddings within a threshold. If we find one, we return the cached response. If not, we forward to the real API and store the result. It's all done at the edge, so latency is minimal.

Interviewer: What about accuracy? Do you ever return wrong responses?

Pranav: We have safeguards. The similarity threshold is tunable, and we log everything. Users can review cached responses. In testing, false positives are rare, but we're monitoring closely.

Interviewer: Tell us about the architecture.

Pranav: The worker handles the proxying and caching. Dashboard is Next.js with real-time updates via Supabase. We use Upstash for Redis because it's serverless and fast. Emails are handled by Resend for reliability.

Interviewer: How did you handle payments?

Pranav: Stripe webhooks. Simple and secure. Billing is monthly based on requests.

Interviewer: What's been the biggest win so far?

Pranav: Seeing users save money. One beta tester said they cut costs by 60%. That's validating.

Interviewer: Any failures?

Pranav: Early on, I had caching issues with long prompts. Had to chunk them. Also, rate limiting was a pain.

Interviewer: How do you market this?

Pranav: Starting with indie communities. This post, then Twitter, Reddit. Word of mouth from beta users.

Interviewer: Final thoughts?

Pranav: AI is expensive, but it doesn't have to be. WatchLLM makes it affordable for everyone.
